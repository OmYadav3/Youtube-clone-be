# Summary of this project
This complex backend project is built with nodejs, expressjs, MongoDB, mongoose, jwt, bcrypt, and many more. It is a complete backend project with all the features a backend project should have. I am building a complete video hosting website similar to YouTube with all the features like login, signup, upload video, like, dislike, comment, reply, subscribe, unsubscribe, and many more.

The project uses all standard practices like JWT, bcrypt, access tokens, refresh Tokens and many more. I  have spent a lot of time building this project and I am sure that you like it.
